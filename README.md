# fhEVM on Evmos 
This repository links to resources needed to run the [fhEVM](https://github.com/zama-ai/fhevm) reference implementation on [Evmos](https://github.com/evmos/evmos).

We use Evmos and Ethermint as a consensus layer on top of which the reference fhEVM implementation is executed. 

Note that this is meant to be used for research purposes only.
