# fhEVM on Evmos 
This repository links to resources needed to run the fhEVM reference implementation on [Evmos](https://github.com/evmos/evmos).

We use Evmos and Ethermint as a consensus layer on top of which the reference fhEVM implementation is executed. 

Note that this version is still in beta.
